## Overview

`recon_suite.py` is a comprehensive Python-based automation toolkit designed for ethical penetration testers to perform extensive network reconnaissance, enumeration, and preliminary attack simulations on authorized target networks and hosts. It integrates a broad range of Kali Linux tools into a flexible, interactive, and modular framework allowing manual or fully automated scans.
